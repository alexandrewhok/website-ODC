                  <p class="col-xs-offset-6 col-xs-3">To obtain the emotions present in the text, we used an external Java library called Synesketch. The classification of the emotions of Synesketch is based on Paul Ekman’s research. From his studies, Ekman defined 6 emotions which could be expressed and detected by facial expressions. These 6 emotions can also be extracted from the text: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. To do so, Synesketch uses a method based on the detec- tion of keywords within the text and the application of heuristic rules from dictionaries based on WordNet, emotions, and common abbreviations. For every analysed text, Synesketch returns the weight values for the 6 emotions, the valence (positive or negative), and a general weight value. These weights represent the intensity of an emotion and vary between 0, not intense, and 1, very intense.

We opted to analyse each sentence in the text independently because the same text can express several emotions. With this, as the emotions change throughout the text, the typeface adapts and also changes to represent the new emotion value.</p>

The valence takes two possible values, 1 for positive and 0 for negati- ve. The general weight represents the intensity of a certain emotion or valence, ranging from 0, not very intense, to 1, very intense.</p>
